If bigger than 650, hide dynamicItem AND show nav
If smaller than 650 show nav AND hide dynamicItem

TO DO
- install Atom package for icons in tabs âœ…
- Git command for pushing and pulling
    -git commit -a -m "Further JS progress"

If window is < 650 upon refresh, regular menu displays :-(
If page is > 650 and is resized <650 without scrolling, no heading displays when small
Header isn't always displaying. Needs changed from sticky to something else.
